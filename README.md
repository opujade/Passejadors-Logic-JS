Creating a website for a dog keeper's bussiness using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The website idea is to make the user capable of booking a day and an hour for dog walks.
There will be a user create page, a login page and a user page where every user will be able to view their bookings.
Also, an admin page for dog keepers to check their client's bookings.
For the moment, this is my idea.
The website will be written in catalan.
